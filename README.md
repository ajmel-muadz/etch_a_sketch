# etch_a_sketch

Hello! This is my first ever *pretty cool* website. By *pretty cool*, I mean something I am very proud of. This 'Etch-a-Sketch' is basically a canvas that allows you to draw on it using any colour you want. There is also a slider that allows for changing the grid size, which determines how pixelated drawings on the canvas are.

## Notice

Since this is my first proper website, I did not optimise it for mobile or very small/large screens. Plus, the website is made on Chrome. I cannot guarantee it will run on different browsers such as Internet Explorer, Edge, Firefox or Safari.
